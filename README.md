# Spam Email Detection Using Machine Learning

## Description

Spam email detection using the Random Forest classifier is an effective approach for distinguishing between legitimate and unwanted emails. Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes predicted by individual trees. In spam detection, features such as word frequency, presence of suspicious links, sender information, and email formatting are extracted from the email text. These features are then used to train the classifier to recognize patterns commonly associated with spam. The strength of Random Forest lies in its ability to handle large datasets with high dimensionality and to reduce overfitting through averaging. As a result, it provides high accuracy and robustness in filtering out spam emails, making it a popular choice in email security systems.
